# Project Title

Implement The Perceptron Algorithm From Scratch In Python

## Getting Started

In this tutorial, you will discover how to implement the Perceptron algorithm from scratch with Python.

After completing this tutorial, you will know:

How to train the network weights for the Perceptron.
How to make predictions with the Perceptron.
How to implement the Perceptron algorithm for a real-world classification problem.

This section provides a brief introduction to the Perceptron algorithm and the Sonar dataset to which we will later apply it.

### Prerequisites

Python 3.8.2

### Installing

Replace file name patch if you want to train your data
My file name patch: filename = 'data/ovarian/ovarian.data'

### Resuls
With 'sonar.all-data'
